A simple app that can use our google maps API to search and show LA-area stores on a map (see https://github.com/mustafasiddiqui/google-maps-api for how to get API running)

Clicking on a store offers options to call it or map directions to it.

NOTE: The call to the Google Maps api needs you to supply your own API key for the Google Maps Javascript API.
